[Horiseon: Online Business Optimization](https://jorullian.github.io/orullian-horiseon-site-module-1-challenge/)

## Description

This project was a refactoring of the Horiseon webpage. The motivation behind this refactoring was a desire to comply with the company's own standards for site optimization and accessibility. The resulting optimization improved all viewers capacity to observe the complete presentation of the site, including image descriptors for the visually impaired; as well as improved the sites own search optimization.

In addition to refactoring, the style.css was adjusted to show elements as they appeared on the index.html. This should make it easier for future developers to see the link between the index and style files. On the index.html file, many element tags were changed to be more descriptive of their styling and position on the webpage. The last change was a concise title for the browser tab.

I ran into an interesting problem in this project. The background image digital-marketing-meeting.jpg from the style.css refused to load correctly on the Chrome browser I was using for debugging. After some trial and error, I found that it was the specific version of Chrome that was having the issue. I was using a dev version of Chrome and opening the site in any other browser, including the standard version of Chrome showed the background image correctly.
